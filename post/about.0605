## About Me

I am a 3rd year master student at Dept. of Data science and computing, Sun Yat-sen University. Currently, I am advised by Prof. [Ruixuan Wang](http://isee.sysu.edu.cn/~wangruixuan/),  [Wei-shi Zheng](http://www.isee-ai.cn/~zhwshi/index.html) and [Jianguo Zhang](http://staff.computing.dundee.ac.uk/jgzhang/) at [iSEE-SYSU](http://www.isee-ai.cn/members.html). I received my B.Sc. Degree from  Dept. of Data science and computing, Sun Yat-sen University in 07/2018. I was a research intern of [Human Cyber Physical Intelligence Integration Lab](http://www.sysu-hcp.net/), advised by Prof. [Liang Lin](http://www.linliang.net/). 

**New!!**:  I am looking for Ph.D position ! !

## Research Interest
