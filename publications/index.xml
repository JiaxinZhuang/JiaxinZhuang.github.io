 Abstract To date, it is still difficult and challenging to automatically classify dermoscopy images. Although the state-of-the-art convolutional networks were applied to solve the classification problem and achieved overall decent prediction results, there is still room for performance improvement, especially for rare disease categories. Considering that human dermatologists often make use of other information (e.</description>

 Abstract To date, it is still an open and challenging problem for intelligent diagnosis systems to effectively learn from imbalanced data, especially with large samples of common diseases and much smaller samples of rare ones. Inspired by the process of human learning, this paper proposes a novel and effective way to embed attention into the machine learning process, particularly for learning characteristics of rare diseases.</description>
